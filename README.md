# Car-Lights-Classifier
Car Lights classifer. In this project I've created my own dataset using photos which were taken by my phone camera and then these images were converted into grey scale. Also I used PCA(Principle Component Analysis) to extract the most important features of my grey scaled images, and then based on those features which were captured by PCA was used to train the CNN model.So then based on these images my CNN model identifies whether the car will take left turn, right turn or its in stationary position based on the input images of the car . (Rear View angle image of the car is taken in most of the images).
